# Spatial-Interpolation-GuestLecture
Guest lecture, code, and assignment on spatial interpolation prepared for USUs GEOG 4870/6870 undergrad/graduate students.
Britta Schumacher, April 2021

## Getting started
If you are participating in the lecture, I suggest you follow along with my [Exerise14-SpatialInterpolation.Rmd](https://github.com/blschum/Spatial-Interpolation-GuestLecture/blob/main/Exerise14-SpatialInterpolation.Rmd), by either following along with the .html or, better yet, delete all text in the code chunks and type it out for yourself! Download the [Week14-interpolation-assignment.Rmd](https://github.com/blschum/Spatial-Interpolation-GuestLecture/blob/main/Week14-interpolation-assignment.Rmd) for your assignment!

## Outline
1. What is spatial interpolation?
2. Useful functions to know for predicting data surfaces from sample points
3. IDW & kriging techniques

## Data source
All [data](https://github.com/blschum/Spatial-Interpolation-GuestLecture/blob/main/data/CA_precip_sf.RDS) is from the RSpatial text.
